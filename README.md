Description: A list payment system for Highridge Construction Company using python and R programming language. 

## Question:
In this assignment, you will act as a software engineer contracted by Highridge Construction Company. Your task is to develop a Python program to facilitate the weekly payments of workers. 

#### Task Description
The program should accomplish the following tasks:

<li> Use variables to create a list of workers dynamically (at least 400 workers).</li>

<li> implement the following conditional statements within the for loop:</li>
<li> If the salary is greater than $10,000 and less than $20,000, assign the Employee level as "A1."</li>
<li>If the salary is greater than $7,500 and less than $30,000 and the employee is female, set the Employee level as "A5-F." </li>

<li> The program started by laying the constant and assigning them variables</li>
