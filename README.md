Description: A payment list system for Highridge Construction Company using python and R programming language. 

## Question:
In this assignment, you will act as a software engineer contracted by Highridge Construction Company. Your task is to develop a Python program to facilitate the weekly payments of workers. 

#### Task Description
The program should accomplish the following tasks:

Use variables to create a list of workers dynamically (at least 400 workers).
Utilize a for loop to generate payment slips for each of the 400 workers.
Implement the following conditional statements within the for loop:
If the salary is greater than $10,000 and less than $20,000, assign the Employee level as "A1."
If the salary is greater than $7,500 and less than $30,000 and the employee is female, set the Employee level as "A5-F."
Add exception handling to your Python code to address potential errors.
Convert your Python code into R.

#### Steps:
i. The program started by laying the constant and assigning them variables
ii. Then a function was created that contains the number of employees
iii. A for loop was used to iterate through the employees and assigned them a salary, a level (with conditional statement), gender, using their employee id
iv. they were appened to an empty list
v. A payment file was created from the list.

The task is both in **python** and **R**
